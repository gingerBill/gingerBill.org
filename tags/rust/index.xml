      <description>**[Originally from a Twitter Thread]**
I have revisited The Value Propagation Experiment and have come to a different conclusion as to why it failed and how I recovered it.
The recovery work has been merged into master now with this PR: https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/pull/1082
I think there were three things which were confusing which make it look like a failure of an experiment:
try was a confusing name for what the semantics were.</description>
