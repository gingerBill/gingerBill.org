      <description>I have recently been thinking about multiple return values as a concept, and wondering if there has been any kind of literature into the topic of &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; multiple return values which are not emulated through tuples. My current working hypothesis is that I think I have come to the conclusion (unless there is evidence to the contrary) Odin has invented a new kind of type system, something to the akin of polyadic expressions.</description>

      <description>**[Originally from a Twitter Thread]**
I have revisited The Value Propagation Experiment and have come to a different conclusion as to why it failed and how I recovered it.
The recovery work has been merged into master now with this PR: https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/pull/1082
I think there were three things which were confusing which make it look like a failure of an experiment:
try was a confusing name for what the semantics were.</description>

Part 2 of this Experiment
The Idea I recently experimented with adding a feature into Odin which allowed for a way to propagate a value by early returning if that value was false or not nil. It was in a similar vein to Rust&amp;rsquo;s try! which became ?, or Zig&amp;rsquo;s try, etc.
I have now removed it from Odin. But why?
The Problem The hypothesis was that that this idiom was common:</description>

      <description>When I was designing the constant value system in Odin, I wanted literals (especially numbers) to &amp;ldquo;just work&amp;rdquo;. I was inspired by how both Ada1 and Go2 both handled their constant value systems. But this lead me to a realization that there are two general different models of thought when it comes to values in programming languages.
Model-1: Expressions have a type, not all expressions may have a value. Therefore all values must have a type.</description>

      <description>One thing I have noticed a lot when a programmer is struggling to solve a problem, especially a novice, is that he is stuck worrying about the &amp;ldquo;best way&amp;rdquo; to implement the solution rather than actually understanding the problem he has. I believe a lot of this stems from not understanding the essence of what programming fundamentally is.
Essentially Ordered Aspects In a previous article of mine, I state that &amp;ldquo;Programming is a tool to solve problems that you have in the domain of computers&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>The Fatal Flaw of Ownership Semantics</title>
      <link>/article/2020/06/21/the-ownership-semantics-flaw/</link>

      <description>I have been toying with a theoretical idea for the past 18 months off-and-on in my head and I have not fully articulated it aloud yet. It is regarding the concept of Ownership Semantics (OS) or Move Semantics in programming languages. Fundamentally this article is a criticism of the concept and states that the concept is a duality of traditional OOP but applied to a different area.
