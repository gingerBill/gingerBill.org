      <description>I have recently been thinking about multiple return values as a concept, and wondering if there has been any kind of literature into the topic of &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; multiple return values which are not emulated through tuples. My current working hypothesis is that I think I have come to the conclusion (unless there is evidence to the contrary) Odin has invented a new kind of type system, something to the akin of polyadic expressions.</description>

      <description>When I was designing the constant value system in Odin, I wanted literals (especially numbers) to &amp;ldquo;just work&amp;rdquo;. I was inspired by how both Ada1 and Go2 both handled their constant value systems. But this lead me to a realization that there are two general different models of thought when it comes to values in programming languages.
Model-1: Expressions have a type, not all expressions may have a value. Therefore all values must have a type.</description>
